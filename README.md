# OpenGL Project

## Short description

## Tasks
### GL.1
- [x] Open file and see what happens
- [x] Rename files
- [x] Enable "rendering"
- [x] Enable/Disable rotation by pressing "Rotate on/off"
- [ ] FPS Counter (Formula might be wrong, need to check)
### GL.2
- [x] Draw a cube (z-cube) at (5,0,1) that rotates on its z-axis every 10 seconds.
- [x] Draw a green cube (x-cube) at (5,0,-3) double as big as z-cube that rotates
      on its x-axis every 5 seconds.
- [x] Draw a square pyramide with its base on the xz-plane, with its base center
      at the origin, with x-length = 4 and z-length = 2. The top of the pyramide
      should be at (0,4,0). Make sure the pyramide just like the cubes with "Rotation on/off".
- [x] Draw a red pyramide which is vertically symmetrical to the previous one.
      Make both pyramides touch tips.
- [ ] Draw a blue pyramide. It should have 40% the size of the other pyramides.
      It should be positioned on the side of the upper pyramide, with the square side 
      of the blue pyramide touching the triangle side of the upper pyramide.
- [x] Make sure all the pyramides rotate with the world rotation.
